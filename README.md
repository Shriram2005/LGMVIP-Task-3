# LGMVIP-WEB-Task-3 Enrollment Form Website
Enrollment form Website



As part of my Let's Grow More Web Development Internship, I've completed the 3rd task - a Job Enrollment Form Website. This project allows users to submit their details and displays them in a table format on the same page.

**Features:**
- User-friendly enrollment form.
- Basic inputs: skills, name, email, profile picture.
- Data displayed in a designed table.

**Tech Used:**
- HTML, CSS for form and styling.
- JavaScript for interactivity.

**Usage:**
1. Open the website in a browser.
2. Fill in your details and upload a profile picture.
3. Click "Submit" to see your information displayed in the table.
